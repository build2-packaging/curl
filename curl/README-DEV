This document describes how curl was packaged for build2. In particular, this
understanding will be useful when upgrading to a new upstream version. See
../README-DEV for general notes on curl packaging.

Symlink the required upstream directories into curl/:

$ ln -s ../../upstream/{src,lib} curl
$ ln -s lib/{strtoofft,nonblock,warnless,curl_ctype}.c curl
$ ln -s src/tool_hugehelp.c.cvs curl/tool_hugehelp.c
$ ln -s ../../libcurl/libcurl/curl_config.h curl

Patch curl to use CA certificate bundle provided by the
libca-certificates-curl package by default:

$ cp curl/src/tool_main.c curl
$ patch -p0 <curl/tool_main.c.patch
