cURL is a client-side software for transferring data using URLs. The curl
command line tool makes the various features of libcurl available from the
shell. For more information see:

https://curl.se/

This package contains the original curl program source code overlaid with the
build2-based build system and packaged for the build2 package manager (bpkg).

See the INSTALL file for the prerequisites and installation instructions.

Send questions, bug reports, or any other feedback about the program itself to
the cURL mailing lists. Send build system and packaging-related feedback to
the packaging@build2.org mailing list (see https://lists.build2.org for
posting guidelines, etc).

The packaging of curl for build2 is tracked in a Git repository at:

https://git.build2.org/cgit/packaging/curl/
