cURL is a client-side software for transferring data using URLs with the
libcurl C library providing the data transfer and URL manipulation APIs. For
more information see:

https://curl.se/

This package contains the original libcurl library source code overlaid with
the build2-based build system and packaged for the build2 package manager
(bpkg).

See the INSTALL file for the prerequisites and installation instructions.

Send questions, bug reports, or any other feedback about the library itself to
the cURL mailing lists. Send build system and packaging-related feedback to
the packaging@build2.org mailing list (see https://lists.build2.org for
posting guidelines, etc).

The packaging of libcurl for build2 is tracked in a Git repository at:

https://git.build2.org/cgit/packaging/curl/
