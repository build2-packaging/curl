# The cURL version has the <major>.<minor>.<patch> form and follows the semver
# semantics. Specifically, the major version is increased when really big
# changes are made, the minor version when new features are added, and the
# patch version is increased for bug fixes. See also:
#
# https://curl.se/docs/versions.html
#
# The ABI version doesn't correlate with the release version and is assigned
# via the libtool's -version-info <current>:<revision>:<age> option
# (VERSIONINFO in lib/Makefile.am). As it follows from the comment in the
# makefile, the major version (current - age) is incremented for backwards-
# incompatible ABI changes. See also:

# https://curl.se/libcurl/abi.html
